# What makes a pattern?

The discussion in the previous section leads us to adopt a three-part schema that underlies every pattern:
*Context*: a situation giving rise to a problem.
*Problem*: the recurring problem arising in that context.
*Solution*: a proven resolution of the problem.

The schema as a whole denotes a type of rule that establishes a relationships between a given context, a certain problem arising in that context, and an appropriate solution to the problem. All three parts of this schema are closely coupled. However, to understand the schema in detail, we have to clarify what we mean by context, problem, and solution.

# Context

# Problem

# Solution
